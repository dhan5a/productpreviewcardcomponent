## Overview

I had to make a responsive product preview card component and did it desktop-first while adding a media query at the end of the code for mobile. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


## My process/questions

This is my first attempt at coding a component with minimal assistance, and there are some mistakes which I have:
1. There is a small gap below the main picture,which makes the text component a little longer than the picture. 

2. For the mobile view, the image has been resized, but it looks awkwardly stretched,and there is (again) a small gap between the picture and the text component. 

If anyone has any suggestions to these two issues, I would be very glad :-)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to style components after watching Madison Kanna's course via FreeCodeCamp's Youtube channel. The syntax is heavily inspired by her workflow.

I would like to focus on image resizing,especially for responsive websites.
