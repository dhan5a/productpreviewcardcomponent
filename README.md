## Overview

I had to make a responsive product preview card component and did it desktop-first while adding a media query at the end of the code for mobile. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to style components after watching Madison Kanna's course via FreeCodeCamp's Youtube channel. The syntax is heavily inspired by her workflow. 

Update: I followed Kevin Powell's tutorial for the same exercise and updated my solution. I learnt CSS Grid and how to use grid template columns. This allows the width of the image and the card content to be of the same size.

For future challenges, I would like to focus on image resizing,especially for responsive websites.
